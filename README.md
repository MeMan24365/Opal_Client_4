# Why?

ev.io can run very bad on computers with a low refresh rate monitor, with the default settings in chrome a shit ton of latency is added due to vsync and some other chromium engine flaws.

Opal client uses chromium switches and gama's community patch to run the game uncapped at a smooth frame rate and lower latency!
